I started this project for fun while working on an arcade cabinet with my son which we dubbed [StarCade](https://github.com/sgsiebers/StarCade/).  Since this is just a side hobby, I have not intended to put a lot of effort into maintaining or documenting it.  While I welcome your contributions, I can't promise that I will be very attentive to merging them into the code base, especially as it reaches maturity for my needs.

Regardless, maybe you'll find it useful to fork and build upon for your own projects. Enjoy!
